					<td>Thomas Raith</td>
					<td>White Court Vampire</td>
					<td class="thirdColumn">Harry's half-brother through their shared mother, and, for a while, his roommate. The only living son of Lord Raith (who usually killed his sons because he wasn't willing to feed on them to force them into submission like he did his daughters and feared them attempting to take over), Thomas is incredibly good looking and oozes sexual appeal to the point that he has difficulty turning it off. In fact, Harry has described Thomas as the Lost Greek God of Body Cologne or the High Priest of Bowflex.</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Molly Carpenter</td>
					<td>Human</td>
					<td class="thirdColumn">Initially a rebel teen daughter of Michael and his wife Charity, Molly soon becomes a more central character during the events of Proven Guilty.<br>
					
					Margaret "Molly" Katherine Amanda Carpenter, during the events of Proven Guilty, seeks out the help of Dresden when her boyfriend is arrested as a suspect in an assault. As Harry investigates the case, he discovers that Molly has manifested as a wizard and has been unwittingly using dark magic in an attempt to help two friends shake off their drug addictions. Realizing that she has broken one of the Laws of Magic by her well-intentioned interference, Molly agrees to accept the consequences of her actions and face the judgment of the White Council.</td>
