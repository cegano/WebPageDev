	<p>In September of 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the Amazon Basin in the Brazilian rainforest, in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist, and in the process learn more about their culture, including their lizrd god Mbwun ("He Who Walks On All Fours"), supposedly the son of Satan. However, Whittlesey disappears after he finds the mutilated body of his partner Crocker, and realizes that a creature in the brush is stalking him. <p>A year later, in Belem, a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from Whittlesey's expedition.</p>
	<p>Seven years later, in a fictionalized version of New York City's American Museum of Natural History, two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum. NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta leads the subsequent investigation, and has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff places under curfew, for fear that the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or possibly in the many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders under wraps as the grand gala opening of the new "Superstition" exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer; an event that will feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even hires New York Times reporter Bill Smithback Jr. to cover the investigation of the murders, but repeatedly edits his reports so that it wil appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the "Museum Beast", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the tunnels under the museum for years, being responsible for the murders. Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the boy's brains.</p>

	<p>In the novel, "Reliquary", the story picks up where the epilogue of Relic left off. Two headless skeletons are found in the Humboldt Kill. When further decapitated bodies follow, there is suspicion of a second Mbwun monster. Major characters from the original book team up with new ones to solve the puzzle. The mystery soon leads underground to the Mole people, and even deeper towards enigmatic beings called the Wrinklers. In the end, it is revealed that the Wrinklers are led by Frock, who has refined a modified version of the Mbwun plant, created by Kawakita to regain the use of his legs. Kawakita also gave the drug to the people who were to become the Wrinklers, later made into his tribe by Frock. After going underground, the group kills them with an explosion, vitamin D infused water and a flood.</p>

	<p>In the novel, "Cabinet of Curiosities", Dr. Nora Kelly's life as an archaeologist at New York City's American Museum of Natural History becomes complicated when Aloysius X.L. Pendergast, a secretive and highly resourceful FBI Special Agent, convinces her to help him uncover the truth behind a string of brutal murders that appears to stretch back 130 years.</p>
	<p>The adventure starts out with the discovery of a long-buried tunnel at a construction site in Manhattan containing the bodies of 36 young people all with parts of their spine removed, buried in the basement. Kelly's assistance as archaeologist is needed by Pendergast.</p>

	<div class="fourth" id="Still">
	<p>In the novel, "Still Life with Crows", a mutilated corpse is found in a cornfield in Medicine Creek, Kansas, drawing Agent Pendergast there. Since he is technically on vacation, he has no official status or resources, and is barely tolerated by the local Sherrif, Hazen.</p>
	<p>The victim, a petty con artist and relic hunter named Shelia Swegg, was found naked in a clearing, with her neck broken. A grisly tableau around the body, consisting of crows impaled on arrows, indicates the work of a serial killer. Pendergast surprises the police when he notices that the arrows are genuine 19th century Cheyenne artifacts, and moreover are almost impossibly well-preserved.</p>
	<p>Pendergast shares some of these details with the editor of the town newspaper, in exchange for an overview of the town and its population. Based on his information, the editor produces a somewhat sensationalist news story, associating the murder with a local town legend, "The Curse of the Forty-Fives."</p>
	<p>But Pendergast upsets both the Sheriff and the editor with his opinion that the killer is local to Medicine Creek, for the simple reason that the town is so isolated that no one could have entered the area outside without being seen.</p>
