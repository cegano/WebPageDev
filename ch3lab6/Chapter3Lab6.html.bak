	<p class="paragraph1">Aloysius Xingu L Pendergast was born circa 1960 and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Pendergast retains his Southern manners and mellifluous Deep Southern accent. He studied Anthropology at Harvard University (graduating summa cum laude) and received a dual Doctor of Philosophy degree in Classics and Philosophy from Oxford University in England (which one of Oxford's component colleges he attended has never been specified).</p>
	
	<div id="paragraph2">
	
	<p>Pendergast once served with the U.S. Special Forces. Most of his military records are classified and unknown.</p>

	<p>A number of years before the series began, Pendergast was married to Helen Esterhazy Pendergast. She was presumed killed in a hunting accident while in Africa (mauled by a lion), but reappears in the so-called Helen Trilogy.</p>

	<p>Pendergast is generally described as being stoically aloof and eccentric, though his ineffable politeness and unerring intellect imbue him with an irresistible charm or enigmatic sense of danger if the occasion should call for it. Well-learned in many subjects, he converses easily with doctors, scientists, intellectuals, vagabonds, highly specialized masters of specific disciplines, and people of a wide variety of language and culture alike. He is a master of psychological manipulation, disguise, and improvisation.</p>

	<div id="paragraphs">
	<p>Pendergast is always described as tall and slender, though it is revealed that he is fit, graceful in movement and physically powerful despite his slight frame. His coloring is pale enough that many people refer to him as "corpse-like" or jokingly as "albino". He has platinum blond hair and ice-blue eyes that often look grey in different lighting. Pendergast religiously dresses in a black, hand-tailored suit made of a special blend of wool not made since the 1950s, and is consequently described as looking like an undertaker.</p>
	
	<p>In many cases, Pendergast's normal appearance is irrelevant. A master of disguises, he has fooled even close acquaintances on several occasions.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Pendergast owns a pair of <a href="https://notoriousluxury.com/tag/1959-rollsroyce-silver-wraith-enri-chapron/">1959 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraiths</a> (one each in New York and Louisiana); his chauffeur and personal assistant is a mysterious man named Proctor. All of Pendergast's suits are custom-made in Italy, and his shoes handmade by John Lobb of London.</li>
	
	<li>His personal sidearm is usually a customized <a href="https://www.lesbaer.com/Premier5.html">.45 Caliber Les Baer Government Model M1911</a> pistol. In Relic he carried a .45 Colt Anaconda double-action revolver. He has also mentioned a Signature Grade Colt 1911 .45ACP tuned by pistolsmith Hilton Yam (now owner of 10-8 Consulting) that has not been seen outside a hypnotherapy session.</li>
	
	<li>Pendergast maintains an apartment at <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/15-crazy-facts-about-nycs-dakota-building2015-8">The Dakota in New York City</a>, and later inherits an internally renovated Beaux Arts mansion near Harlem from his great-granduncle in The Cabinet of Curiosities. In his apartment there is a fully furnished zen garden where Pendergast likes to take time to meditate before a new challenge.</li>
	
	<li>Though he is a scrupulously scientific man, he wears a sort of talisman or amulet on a chain, that consists of his own modified version of the Pendergast family crest: a lidless eye over two moons, one new and one full, with a phoenix (the original version featured a lion).</li>
	
	<li>Pendergast carries a variety of hidden tools, such as lock picks, flashlights of various sizes, test tubes, syringes, and forensic chemicals.</li>
